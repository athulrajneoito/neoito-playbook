# QA challenges with agile software development
- Chances of error are more in agile, as documentation is given less priority, which eventually puts more pressure on the QA team
- New features are introduced quickly, which reduces the available time for test teams to identify whether the latest features are according to the requirement and does it truly address the business suits
- Testers are often required to play a semi-developer roled
- Test execution cycles are highly compressed
- Very less time to prepare a test plan
- For regression testing, they will have minimal timing
- Change in their role from being a gate-keeper of quality to being a partner in Quality
- Requirement changes and updates are inherent in an agile method, becoming the biggest challenge for QA
