The agile testing quadrants separate the whole process in four Quadrants and help to understand how agile testing is performed.

a) Agile Quadrant I – The internal code quality is the main focus in this quadrant, and it consists of test cases that are technology driven and are implemented to support the team, it includes

- Unit Tests
- Component Tests

b) Agile Quadrant II – It contains test cases that are business driven and are implemented to support the team.  This Quadrant focuses on the requirements. The kind of test performed in this phase is

- Testing of examples of possible scenarios and workflows
- Testing of User experience such as prototypes
- Pair testing

c) Agile Quadrant III – This quadrant provides feedback to quadrants one and two.  The test cases can be used as the basis to perform automation testing.  In this quadrant, many rounds of iteration reviews are carried out which builds confidence in the product.  The kind of testing done in this quadrant is

- Usability Testing
- Exploratory Testing
- Pair testing with customers
- Collaborative testing
- User acceptance testing

d) Agile Quadrant IV – This quadrant concentrates on the non-functional requirements such as performance, security, stability, etc.  With the help of this quadrant, the application is made to deliver the non-functional qualities and expected value.

- Non-functional tests such as stress and performance testing
- Security testing with respect to authentication and hacking
- Infrastructure testing
- Data migration testing
- Scalability testing
- Load testing
