# Project Plans

Project plans are often viewed as something that is good in theory but not in practice. Why? It probably has a lot to do with how they are created—without useful preparation and stakeholder follow-through, they can quickly be abandoned.

This 6-step, high-level guide will help you write a project plan and provide recommendations for project management software that will make each stage of the process simpler.

***What is a project plan?***

Your project plan is a formal document that outlines an entire project’s goals and objectives, specific tasks, and what success looks like.

In addition to setting the purpose of your project, it should include other materials and deliverables relevant to the project, such as:

 * Timelines and Gantt charts for key milestones
 * Communication plans
 * Work breakdown structure—especially if you have multiple team members working on different or simultaneous tasks (in that case, you may also need a Project Planner)
 * Resources need to complete the project, like project management tools, cash, freelancers, and more.

***In short, your project plan serves as a central hub to define, organize, prioritize, and assign activities and resources throughout your project’s life cycle.***
