# Is there a process to project management? Yesâ€”and we break down all five phases


The Project Management Institute (PMI) breaks down the project management process into five phases that are relatively well-agreed upon in the project management space:

 1. [Initiating](./initiating.md)
 2. [Planning](./planning.md)
 3. [Execution](./execution.md)
 4. [Monitoring](./monitoring.md)
 5. [Closing](./closing.md)
