# Initiating

As with any good project, preparation is vital to ensure it will be completed on time and within [budget](https://monday.com/blog/project-management/project-budget/). During the initiation phase, determine the following to create the project foundation:

* **Project scope**: the specific limits and boundaries for the project. It essentially covers what will be accomplished in the project and what will not (i.e [project objectives](https://monday.com/blog/project-management/effective-project-objectives-how-to-define-and-achieve-success/)). Establishing these boundaries prevents something called “scope creep.” You can learn more about it [here](https://monday.com/blog/project-management/keep-scope-creep-undermining-project/).
* High-level project overview: This considers the resources, time, and goals required to complete a project. Included in the overview is a way to monitor these requirements over time.
* Budgets: How much is needed to achieve a successful project?


For larger projects, a [project charter](https://monday.com/blog/project-management/project-charter-template/) or “Project Initiation Documentation” (PID) might be established.
