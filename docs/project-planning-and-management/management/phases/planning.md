#Planning

During this phase, [key milestones](https://monday.com/blog/project-management/milestones/) and dates are set, including the final project completion date. By getting clear and intentional about project timing, you can help ensure that all team members move towards the same goal. This will also save you a road of confusion ahead when you encounter roadblocks.

During this process, it’s important to outline which project management methodology the team will follow. There are many to choose from: Agile, Waterfall, PRINCE2, PMBOK, Scrum, Lean, and Kanban (to name a few of the more popular ones). We’ll get into more specifics around some of these later in this guide.

The planning phase also includes:

  * Selecting the team members
  * Outlining deliverables
  * Estimating resources
  * Determining associated activities
