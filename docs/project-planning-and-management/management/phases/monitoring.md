# Monitoring/Controlling

This is crucial in any project life cycle as it helps project managers answer the question: where are we at any given point in the project vs. where should we be according to the project plan? Effective monitoring requires:

    * Regular, consistent project “check-ins”
    * Use of proper project documentation and tracking tools or frameworks (such as Kanban boards, Gantt charts, and team stand-ups). The more visual and real-time this is, the better as you can then easily communicate it to key players and adjust.
