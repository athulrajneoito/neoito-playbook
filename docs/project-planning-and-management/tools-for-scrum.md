#Tools for Scrum

There are some tools used in scrum:
 
***Scrum board*** can be divided into the following columns: to do, work in progress, and done. The board is kept updated during the sprint. For example, if there’s a new task appeared, it is written on the card and put on the board.


***User stories*** describe software from the user’s point of view. It includes the type of the user, what and why he wants it. The short stories have their own structure: as a <user type>, I want to <complete a task> in order to <accomplish the goal>.


***Burndown chart*** represents all outstanding work. It helps to warn the team if something goes wrong and show the impact of the decisions made by the team.


***Timeboxing*** is a specified time period during which the team works toward a common goal.


***Icebox*** is a place where user stories that are recorded but not developed are kept.
