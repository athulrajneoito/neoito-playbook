# UX - User flow

User experience design is ultimately about answering What the person on the other side of the screen actually wants. User flow is a key to the whole user experience of the product. The goal of UX is to nurture usersâ€™ loyalty and satisfaction with your business by helping them solve a problem or complete a task in the most comfortable and enjoyable way. And that can only be done through a series of planned-out interactions a user will have with the product. Interactions that would lead them through the product pages smoothly, like entering a flow state.

The process of user flow creation can be divided into 4 steps.

- Planning (sketching your goals and entry points)
- Designing (creating the first flow and upgrading it)
- Documenting (crafting the user flow diagram and sharing it)
- Testing (collecting metrics and performing analysis)
