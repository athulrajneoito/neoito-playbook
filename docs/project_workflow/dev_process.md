1. From the product backlog, stories are moved to the sprint backlog so that the developers can start working on them.
2. Within the development phase, the following steps take place:
    * **Development in progress**
    * **In review** - Once review is completed, the code is deployed to dev environment for dev testing.
    * **Ready for dev test** - If dev test fails, it goes back to the development phase again. If dev test is completed successfully, it moves on the to the next step in the cycle.
    * **Ready for QA deployment** - Deployed to QA env by TL
    * **Ready for QA** 

3. Once in QA phase, the following steps take place:
    * **Quality Analysis** - IF QA fails, it moves back again to the development phase. If QA is passed, it moves on to the next step in the cycle.
    * **Ready for UAT deployment** - Deployed to UAT
    * **Ready for UAT**

4. Once in the UAT phase, the following steps take place:
    * **User Acceptance Testing**(UAT)
    * **Ready for Production deployment** - If UAT fails, it moves back again to the development phase. If UAT is completed successfully, the code is ready for production deployment.
    * **Go live** - deployed to production.
