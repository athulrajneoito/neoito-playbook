Workflow, or business process, is a collection of steps (typically sequential) that must be executed to complete tasks and achieve a specific objective. Workflows are repeatable and also handle how we move between different tasks.

So, we can define project management workflow as the process of managing tasks and activities required to complete a project into an effective and efficient sequence. You can achieve this by visualizing the project into a workflow diagram.

A key aspect of project management workflow is to divide the project into smaller milestones and divide these milestones into measurable tasks. No matter how large and complex a project is, it will always have its workflow.

We can use various methods to visualize a project as a workflow, but the ANSI (American National Standards Institute) flowchart is the most popular method.
