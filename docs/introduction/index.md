# Introduction


Have you heard about Murphy’s Law?

It simply says,

"Anything that can go wrong will go wrong and at the worst possible time."

And software development is not immune to the above.

So as budding experts in the field, we have to do everything in our power to shield ourselves from the evils of errors.

From the inception of NeoITO, one of the main challenges we have been facing to date is the lack of process in our software development. Our aim is to make this a tale of the past.

To address this challenge head-on, we realized that it is crucial to establish a standard across our cross-functional teams and bring them together to create a quality product. 

Because, the quality of the software we make is directly related to the engineering quality, which is in turn connected to the engineering process. Therefore, it is essential to have a standardised engineering process to deliver the right product on time.

This playbook seeks to provide transparency into our software development process and help our colleagues stay on the same page any day every day. 

So here is a collection of our experiences and learnings when it comes to making successful web and mobile products. In this, you'll find some of the ways we've found to be effective, as well as the lessons we learned from the mistakes we made along the way. 

Hopefully, this can serve as a helpful guide for anyone who wants to create their own successful products.
## Why Have A Playbook
- To increase overall efficiency for team members and the whole team in general.
- To reduce the number of mistakes and avoid common pitfalls.
- To strive to be better engineers and learn from other people's shared experiences.
## General Guidance
- Keep the code quality bar high.
- Value quality and precision over ‘getting things done.
- Work diligently on the one crucial thing.
- As a distributed team take time to share context via wiki, teams, and backlog items.
- Make the simple thing work now. Build fewer features today, but ensure they work amazingly. Then add more features tomorrow.
- Avoid adding scope to a backlog item, instead, add a new backlog item.
- Our goal is to ship incremental customer value.
- Keep backlog item details up to date to communicate the state of things with the rest of your team.
- Report product issues found and provide clear and repeatable engineering feedback!
- We all own our code and each one of us has an obligation to make all parts of the solution great.
