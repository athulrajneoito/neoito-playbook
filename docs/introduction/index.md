# Introduction


Have you heard about Murphyâ€™s Law?

It simply says,

"Anything that can go wrong will go wrong and at the worst possible time."

And software development is not immune to the above.

So as budding experts in the field, we have to do everything in our power to shield ourselves from the evils of errors.

From the inception of NeoITO, one of the main challenges we have been facing to date is the lack of process in our software development. Our aim is to make this a tale of the past.

To address this challenge head-on, we realized that it is crucial to establish a standard across our cross-functional teams and bring them together to create a quality product. 

Because, the quality of the software we make is directly related to the engineering quality, which is in turn connected to the engineering process. Therefore, it is essential to have a standardised engineering process to deliver the right product on time.

This playbook seeks to provide transparency into our software development process and help our colleagues stay on the same page any day every day. 

So here is a collection of our experiences and learnings when it comes to making successful web and mobile products. In this, you'll find some of the ways we've found to be effective, as well as the lessons we learned from the mistakes we made along the way. 

Hopefully, this can serve as a helpful guide for anyone who wants to create their own successful products.
