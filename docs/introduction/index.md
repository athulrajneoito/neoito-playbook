# Introduction

## Why Have A Playbook
- To increase overall efficiency for team members and the whole team in general.
- To reduce the number of mistakes and avoid common pitfalls.
- To strive to be better engineers and learn from other people's shared experiences.
## General Guidance
- Keep the code quality bar high.
- Value quality and precision over â€˜getting things done.
- Work diligently on the one crucial thing.
- As a distributed team take time to share context via wiki, teams, and backlog items.
- Make the simple thing work now. Build fewer features today, but ensure they work amazingly. Then add more features tomorrow.
- Avoid adding scope to a backlog item, instead, add a new backlog item.
- Our goal is to ship incremental customer value.
- Keep backlog item details up to date to communicate the state of things with the rest of your team.
- Report product issues found and provide clear and repeatable engineering feedback!
- We all own our code and each one of us has an obligation to make all parts of the solution great.
