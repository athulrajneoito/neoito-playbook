#Agile

Agile planning is a project management style with an incremental, iterative approach. Instead of using an in-depth plan from the start of the project—typically product-related—Agile leaves room for requirement changes throughout and relies on constant end-user feedback.

Being Agile means learning from experience and continually improving. Agile development provides more learning cycles than traditional project planning due to the tighter process loops. Each sprint provides something new for the team to learn.

For example:

- A team delivers value to the customer, gets feedback, and then modifies their backlog based on that feedback.
- They learn that their automated builds are missing key tests and include work in their next sprint to address it.
- They find that certain features perform poorly in production and make plans to improve performance.
- Someone on the team hears of a new practice and the team decides to try it out for a few sprints.

Teams just starting with Agile development should expect more learning opportunities. They are an invaluable part of the process because they lead to growth and improvement.
