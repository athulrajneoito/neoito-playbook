An effective Sprint Review is not just about a demo. The demo is surely useful as it provokes thoughtful discussion about what was successfully built and what needs to be created in the future. However, during this Scrum meeting, your main focus should be on collaboration, not demonstration.

Remember that Sprint Review is a great chance for your team to regularly inspect and adapt the product.
