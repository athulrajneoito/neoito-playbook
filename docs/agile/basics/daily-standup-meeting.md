**Daily Standup Meeting**


Once you have the schedule down and you’ve planned your sprint, from the very beginning of the sprint you’ll gather the entire team and have every team member report on their status. There are a few components to these meetings:

- Daily agile planning meetings are typically *standup meetings*, to encourage brevity.
- They have a maximum duration of 15 minutes.
- Each member has no more than one minute to report “what I did yesterday,” “what I’ll do today,” “what’s in my way” from accomplishing the task on time.
- The task status can only be “done” or “not done,” and if it’s not done, team members should state how many hours remain to finish up.
- Obstacles encountered by team members should be briefly stated and discussed later in the relevant forum.
- The Scrum Master or release manager is responsible for coordinating and helping team members overcome obstacles.

We threw a lot of information at you regarding scheduling, planning, and running standups during your sprint. That’s a lot to take in, yet alone visualize how it could look. That’s why many teams use a Work Operating Software (Work OS) to help them run their projects, communicate with team members, and track all updates in real-time.
