### **Champion trust**
This is a huge part of the agile team's success. You have to trust that the people on your team are skilled in their area and capable of making judgments about the process. If you doubt your teammates or have to double-check every decision made, or approve every idea before execution, the agile framework wonâ€™t work. By assigning owners on your plans, everyone can see who is responsible for what and it also creates accountability.

The Chanty team builds projects around motivated individuals, and give everyone the room and the tools (including [marketing management tools](https://monday.com/use-cases/marketing-project-management)) they need to get the job done, and then trusts them with the process.
