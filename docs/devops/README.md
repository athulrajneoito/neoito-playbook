# Introduction

The concept of DevOps allows the Development and Operations teams to work together in a collaborative or shared manner which results in a constant and seamless communication amongst the team members.

# Why DevOps is Beneficial For Us?

* Collaboration & Trust - Lack of visibility and shared goals means lack of dependency planning, misaligned priorities, finger pointing, and “not our problem” mentality, resulting in slower velocity and substandard quality. DevOps is that change in mindset of looking at the development process holistically and breaking down the barrier between development and operations.
* Release faster and work smarter - Teams that practice DevOps release deliverables more frequently, with higher quality and stability. 
* Accelerate time-to-resolution - Full transparency and seamless communication enables teams to minimize downtime and resolve issues faster.
* Better manage unplanned work - With established processes and clear prioritization, development and operations teams can better manage unplanned work while continuing to focus on planned work.
