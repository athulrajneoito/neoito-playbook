# Architecture Work Process

Architecture Work Processes are groups of activities centered around a common theme, such as the governance and management of architecture. The benefit of identifying and recognizing processes is that you will start to align the activities with each other more so they act more efficiently and effectively together. This all will result in processes with a higher quality result and outcome. All the activities that make up the work of an architect are grouped into work processes. This makes it easier for people to work together or to take over someone else's work. In every work process, each activity has a defined input and output. Many activities contribute to the creation of a deliverable.
