# What does an architect in the organization normally do?

## The Architect's Function
In short, an architect is a designer who works closely with clients and stakeholders to create

architectures and architecture designs for systems and to realize these systems for organizations in various aspect areas, such as business, data, application, IT infrastructure, and security. Architecture is a set of concepts and principles that are applied to a system to make that system more robust, functional, usable, and beautiful for a large group of different users. By applying to a system, we mean that an architecture design of the system is made, in which the concepts and principles are visible and measurable. The system produces a (partial) solution for the challenge facing the organization at that time. The function of an architect is to be a person who makes designs for certain cross-sections or sub-areas of an organization. In some cases, the architect also makes the planning and in some cases executes the designs.

An architect is a planner, designer, and implementer who consciously uses concepts and principles when creating and realizing a design. In order to be able to make architecture and an architecture design, the architect needs input. This input is formed by a program of requirements, in order to be able to unite a collection of requirements (which are sometimes contradictory) in a building.

An architect receives architecture design assignments (also called architecture assignments or design assignments).
