# Sequence Diagram

A Sequence diagram is a structured representation of behavior as a series of sequential steps over time. You can use it to:

- Depict workflow, Message passing and how elements in general cooperate over time to achieve a result
- Capture the flow of information and responsibility throughout the system, early in analysis; Messages between elements eventually become method calls in the Class model
- Make explanatory models for Use Case scenarios; by creating a Sequence diagram with an Actor and elements involved in the Use Case, you can model the sequence of steps the user and the system undertake to complete the required tasks
## Construction
- Sequence elements are arranged in a horizontal sequence, with Messages passing back and forward between elements
- Messages on a Sequence diagram can be of several types; the Messages can also be configured to reflect the operations and properties of the source and target elements (see the Notes in the Message Help topic)
- An Actor element can be used to represent the user initiating the flow of events
- Stereotyped elements, such as Boundary, Control and Entity, can be used to illustrate screens, controllers and database items, respectively
- Each element has a dashed stem called a Lifeline, where that element exists and potentially takes part in the interactions
